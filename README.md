# Kedro-Dolt

[Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/) is a new SQL database with Git versioning. This plugin versions dataframes used by your Kedro workflows and was a collaboration between [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/01_introduction/01_introduction.html) and [DoltHub]((https://www.dolthub.com/)) designed to expand the data versioning abilities of data scientists and engineers.

The [tutorial repo](https://github.com/dolthub/kedro-dolt-demo?organization=dolthub&organization=dolthub) shows an example of what this looks like in practice. The [plugin blog post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-06-16-kedro-dolt-plugin/) details Kedro, Dolt and the plugin.
